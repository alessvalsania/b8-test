```bash
npm i

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
For LAN accesing for mobile
```bash
ng serve --port 4201 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or `http://192.168.x.x:4201/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
